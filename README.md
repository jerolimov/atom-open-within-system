**Deprecated. But still ready for the [atom.io](http://atom.io) 1.0 release.**

I developed this plugin for an early [atom.io](http://atom.io) version where
this function was missing. The latest version contains already the
"Show in Finder" menu, but not the "Open with default application" entry.

This plugin provides both functions - but will not be supported in the future.

## Show and open files within your file manager and terminal

You can install this small [atom.io](http://atom.io) extension in the
`Preferences... > Install` dialog OR with the atom package manager:

    apm install show-in-system

This extension adds new sub menu entries to the context-menu of the
file/project tree and the editor tabs.

* Add `Show in Finder / Explorer` to each editor tab.  
* Add `Open in Terminal` for folders and files (scripts) in the file tree and
  tab context-menu.
  Current this is an OSX-only feature.
  Pull requests for other systems are welcome.
* Add `Open with default application` in the file tree and tab context-menu.
